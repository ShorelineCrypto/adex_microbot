# PostmarketOS - Alpine linux on old android phones

PostmarketOS is an open-source operating system project built on Alpine Linux that support many old android phone models. 

Alpine linux on CLI interface (no need for GUI) has docker installed by default. Because adex_microbot support docker on arm64 software, virtually most of old android phones can be re-used by installing postmarketOS for running adex_microbot as arbitrage bot, regualr pool bot or AMM pool bot in Cheetahdex/Komodo DEX.
